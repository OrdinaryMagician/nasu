I created this out of boredom. Hope you enjoy.

If you have anything to say bout this little program, just email me.

Reference:

Normal NASU (Purple): Fall down from the sky, if one touches the ground, the game ends [10pts] (small random chance of getting a 1000pts bonus)
Bouncing NASU (Red and Blue): Bounce around from left to right (blue) or from right to left (red) [300pts]

Controls:

Left / Right or A / D -> Move
Up, Left Shift, Z or W -> Jump
P -> Pause
F12 -> Take screenshot
F10 -> Toggle fullscreen (if possible)

Command line parameters:

NASU [-#] [-fullscreen]

-# : resize factor for the game window (2 by default)
-fullscreen : start the game in fullscreen (if the resolution is not valid it will start windowed)

Special Thanks:

Kikiyama for making the actual mini-game in Yume Nikki.
