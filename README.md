NASU Standalone 1.2, a port to SDL because SFML sucks horribly.

I tried to keep the source well-written and well-documented.

Support for Windows is just perfect now.

Will try to support other platforms later.

Building: Use the makefile. Just make and then sudo make install. I also provided targets "uninstall" and "reinstall".

Requirements: SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf and SDL_gfx.

I love SDL.
